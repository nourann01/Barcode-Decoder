# Barcode Decoding 
This project focuses on developing a **robust and generic barcode decoding pipeline** using **image processing** and **computer vision (CV)** techniques. 

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The pipeline handles:
- Preprocessing distorted or noisy barcode images
- Handles salt-and-pepper noise, blur, and rotation
- Cropping and straightening the barcode region
- Decoding the barcode accurately

It is designed to be **generic and adaptable** to a wide range of test cases without requiring any manual tuning or test-specific conditions.
