# Barcode-Decoder
This project implements a robust pipeline for barcode detection and decoding. It includes preprocessing steps to fix image distortions, crop and straighten the barcode region, and accurately decode the barcode data. The solution is designed to work generically across various test cases without manual adjustments.
